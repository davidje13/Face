# Face.js

<img src="screenshots/face.png" align="right" width="200" />

Renders an interactive ball-shaped face on the page.

This is a modern HTML5 remake of a project I made a long time ago in
Flash. The faces come from the old project, but the rendering has been
re-written from scratch for better consistency and more supported
geometries.
