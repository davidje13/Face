## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository and run:

```shell
npm install;
npm start;
```

This will launch a server in the project directory. You can now open
the [sample page](http://localhost:8080/).

To run the linter, run the command:

```shell
npm test;
```

And to rebuild the minified sources, run:

```shell
npm run minify;
```

## Commands

The available commands are:

* `npm start`: runs a webserver on
  [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* `npm test`: runs the `lint` command
* `npm run lint`: runs the linter against all source files
* `npm run minify`: minifies the library code in `/lib`
* `npm run generate-screenshots`: regenerates the screenshots and
  favicon
